# Week 5 Assignment – C++ Playlist Menu

## Description
This is a simple C++ program created for **Module 5: Functions and Loops**.  
It demonstrates the use of:
- Functions (`void` functions for menu actions)  
- Loops (`do...while` to keep showing the menu)  
- Switch statements for handling user choices  

The program simulates a basic playlist menu with three options:
1. View songs in the playlist  
2. Play a song  
3. Exit the program  

---

## Features
- **Menu system** that keeps looping until the user exits  
- **View songs**: Displays a fixed playlist of 3 songs  
- **Play song**: Lets the user pick which song to “play”  
- **Exit**: Closes the program gracefully  

---

## How to Compile
Using `g++`, run this in the terminal:

```bash
g++ Week-5-Assignment.cpp -o Week5
./Week5
