# Week 4 Assignment

## Part 1 – Playlist Menu
This program displays a simple menu with four options:
1. View songs in the playlist  
2. Add a new song to the playlist  
3. Download songs  
4. Exit  

The user chooses an option by typing the number.  
- If they pick **1**, the program prints the songs already in the playlist.  
- If they pick **2**, it asks for the name of a new song and confirms it was "added."  
- If they pick **3**, it prints a message pretending to download songs.  
- If they pick **4**, the program exits.  
- Any other number prints "Invalid option."  

## Part 2 – Largest of Three Numbers
This program asks the user to enter **three numbers**.  
It then uses if statements to compare them step by step and prints out the largest number.  

The logic works by:
1. Comparing the first number with the second.  
2. If the first is larger, it checks against the third.  
3. Otherwise, it compares the second against the third.  
4. Finally, it prints whichever number is largest.  

Note: Program does not account for when numbers are of equal value
